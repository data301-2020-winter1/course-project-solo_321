## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

As a management student specializing in Accounting, I would like to understand the business world's application of information systems. COSC301 project allows me to get involved with the DevOps movement by using the data set of automated accounting systems. By understanding how to analyze data with computers and perform corporate processes activities, I would like to reduce discrepancies between developers and operators. My interest in this project is to identify how data analysis can improve existing accounting systems. This project will focus on analyzing large datasets, and by creating an efficient program, a computer will process the data in a matter of seconds. Information systems play an essential role in the logistics industry because it is one of the highest in operating costs and liquidity. By automating operating costs with enterprise resource planning, a corporation can lower administrative costs. Naturally, managers can meet their objectives, which is increasing the shareholder's wealth.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

CocaCola is a corporation that has many warehouses worldwide. Inside their operating environment, they need to move their products between the production factory and their warehouses. These logistics movements are outsourced with a logistics company. Every week, both corporations have an accounting system that creates a spreadsheet for all the logistic activities. CocaCola uses their spreadsheet to show which services they are paying, and the logistic company's spreadsheet is used to charge the recorded trips. Coca Cola spreadsheet contains the following attributes in their dataset, date, trip id, start-location, end-location, distance. On the other hand, the logistics company has the following attributes, trip id, driver, wagon plate, truck plate, date, start-location, end-location, distance, revenue. On both datasets, each row in the dataset represents a logistic trip. These datasets are recorded as excel spreadsheets, and for programming usage, the files will be saved as a comma-separated value format. Coca Cola makes one weekly spreadsheet for their products. However, the logistic company produces two weekly spreadsheets, one for the movement of Coca Cola water bottles and one for Coca Cola carbonated drinks. All the data is from the current year and for this milestone it will contain the data for week 42 of this year.
